# SQL Trainer for Academic and Play: a zero-install SQLite playground that runs in your browser

TLDR: Check <https://softwareengel.github.io/hacker-codes/>
 

If you’ve ever tried to teach (or learn) SQL in a classroom, you know the “first hour problem”: installing a database, setting up credentials, dealing with different OSes, and then explaining why a query fails for reasons unrelated to SQL.

  

This project is my attempt to remove that friction entirely.

  

The result is a small, static web app: an interactive SQL training platform that runs SQLite in the browser via WebAssembly (SQL.js), with a real editor (CodeMirror), curated examples, and realistic sample databases. No backend. No accounts. It can work offline as a PWA after the first load.

  

## What it is

  

A client-side SQL learning environment that lets you:

  

- Load a sample database (e.g. employees, e-commerce, school, countries/counties)

- Browse example SQL files by topic (basics → joins → aggregations → subqueries → advanced → DDL/DML)

- Run SQL and inspect results immediately

- Save queries and keep a local query history (IndexedDB)

- Export results (CSV/JSON)

  

It is intentionally “just HTML/CSS/JS”, because the goal is to be deployable anywhere static files can live (GitHub Pages included) and to be easy to understand and extend in an academic context.

  

## Who it’s for

  

- Instructors: a reliable in-class demo tool that doesn’t require local DB installs

- Students: a safe sandbox for practicing SQL repeatedly without setup fatigue

- Builders: a lightweight “SQL scratchpad” for quick prototyping and experimenting

  

The name “Academic and Play” is deliberate: the same environment works for structured coursework and for playful exploration.

  

## The design constraints (and why they matter)

  

I built the platform around a few hard constraints that keep it practical:

  

- Zero backend: everything runs in-browser

- Deterministic sample data: the same queries produce the same results for everyone

- Offline-first: caching + local storage make it resilient in real classrooms

- Small mental model: vanilla JS modules and clear component boundaries

  

Under the hood, the app is basically:

  

- UI (file browser, editor, results)

- Application controller (glue)

- SQLite manager (SQL.js WASM)

- Storage manager (IndexedDB)

  

## A short origin story (from the repo)

  

This project lives inside the `hacker-codes` repository as `2026/2026-04-dbms-sql`.

  

The commit history shows a very pragmatic evolution:

  

- 2026-04-10: foundation and early validation work (unit tests, refactors)

- 2026-04-11: GitHub Pages deployment pipeline and a real-world “it works locally, fails on Pages” fix

- 2026-04-18: E2E reliability work across browsers and mobile viewports

- 2026-04-19: product features that improve the learning loop (run current statement vs run all statements) and more realistic datasets (Counties database)

  

I kept a prompt-by-prompt build log in `doc/chatlog/` while iterating, which turned out to be a surprisingly useful way to document the engineering story.

  

## Quality as a feature: tests and “no surprises” behavior

  

A learning tool is only helpful if it behaves consistently.

  

That’s why a lot of effort went into:

  

- Playwright E2E tests (multiple desktop browsers and mobile viewports)

- Fixing race conditions that only show up under automation

- Making the UI predictable: visible/hidden states, stable selectors, clear status messages

  

One concrete example from the build log: early on, E2E tests were failing because “Ready” status could appear before the database had actually loaded. Tightening the “Connected to …” readiness signal and preventing duplicate loads (by ensuring a fresh SQL.js Database instance per batch load) turned flakey tests into deterministic ones.

  

## The feature that changed the teaching flow: Run Current vs Run All

  

Many SQL teaching files contain multiple statements separated by semicolons.

  

A single “Run Query” button forces students to either:

  

- delete statements, or

- copy/paste, or

- comment/uncomment blocks.

  

So the platform added two execution modes:

  

- Run Current: execute the statement under the cursor (or the current selection)

- Run All: parse and run all statements sequentially

  

The parser is intentionally simple but practical: it splits on semicolons while respecting strings and comments.

  

In practice, this is one of those “small” UX changes that reduces friction dramatically during exercises and live demos.

  

## Datasets: realistic enough to teach joins (without overwhelming beginners)

  

The platform includes multiple sample databases with different “shapes”:

  

- Employees (HR-like tables)

- E-Commerce (orders, products, categories)

- School (courses, students, enrollments)

- Counties/Countries (geographic entities and relationships)

  

There is also a documented attempt to add Northwind (the classic Microsoft sample database). The build log captures a real-world gotcha: reserved keywords and identifier quoting (e.g. a table called “Order Details”). That entry is intentionally kept as a learning artifact—because SQL education includes these sharp edges.

  

## Prompt-driven development log (abridged)

  

Below is a condensed “prompt → change” history extracted from the files in `doc/chatlog/`. This is not meant as marketing; it’s meant as an honest engineering trace.

  

### 2026-04-10 — Fix Playwright E2E failures

  

Prompt intent:

  

- “Fix all remaining Playwright E2E test failures”

  

Outcomes:

  

- Improved database loading determinism in tests (wait for explicit connection state)

- Removed a duplicate-load failure mode (“table already exists”) by reinitializing SQL.js DB on batch load

- Fixed strict locator issues and modal timing assumptions

- Implemented query history refresh so UI reflects persisted history

- Result: 37/37 Playwright tests passing for the targeted suite

  

### 2026-04-11 — GitHub Pages 404 for lib/ assets

  

Prompt intent:

  

- “Fix missing lib files causing 404 errors on GitHub Pages”

  

Outcome:

  

- Root cause was gitignore excluding `lib/` while the app referenced local `lib/` paths

- Fix was to include the required `lib/` assets in the repository so static hosting works

  

This is a classic example of why “static app” doesn’t automatically mean “deployment is trivial”: your dependencies must be shipped.

  

### 2026-04-18 — Mobile E2E and cross-browser stability

  

Prompt intent:

  

- “Fix failing Playwright tests on mobile viewports”

  

Outcomes:

  

- Sidebar is off-screen on mobile by CSS transform; tests needed a reliable way to open it

- Added helpers that open/close the sidebar for mobile runs without impacting desktop behavior

- Reduced CodeMirror timing flakiness by waiting for editor initialization where necessary

- Adjusted performance thresholds for browser variance

- Result: 148/148 tests passing across the configured desktop browser projects

  

### 2026-04-19 — Run Current vs Run All Statements

  

Prompt intent:

  

- “Execute only statement under cursor or selection; also run all statements”

  

Outcomes:

  

- Editor gained cursor/selection introspection

- Added statement parsing that respects strings and comments

- Run All executes statements sequentially and reports summary feedback

  

### 2026-04-19 — Northwind database addition (documented attempt)

  

Prompt intent:

  

- “Add Northwind SQLite database as a sample DB”

  

Outcome:

  

- The log captures schema + data shaping decisions (e.g. removing BLOB-heavy fields)

- Also captures the quoting/reserved-keyword issue that blocked a clean integration

- Status: recorded as an in-progress attempt and kept as a learning note

  

## Why I think this belongs on Hacker News / YC radar

  

This is not trying to out-compete full SQL IDEs.

  

It’s a “fast, local, repeatable learning loop” for SQL:

  

- Students can start in seconds

- Instructors can rely on consistent behavior

- The codebase is intentionally approachable (vanilla JS, clear modules)

  

In other words: it’s a small tool that removes a surprisingly large amount of classroom friction.

  

## Try it (developer-friendly)

  

The simplest way to run:

  

- Open <https://softwareengel.github.io/hacker-codes/>  in a modern browser

- Or serve the folder with a small local server (recommended for WASM loading)

- Or checkout repo project from repo  <https://github.com/softwareengel/hacker-codes/tree/main/2026/2026-04-dbms-sql> 

  

There are dedicated test suites (Jest + Playwright) that acted as guardrails during the build.

  

## What’s next (small, realistic)

  

If I continue iterating, the next steps will likely be:

  

- Polish the “Northwind integration” path by standardizing identifier quoting and avoiding reserved-word traps

- Keep expanding example sets where they improve the teaching arc (not just for “more content”)

- Maintain cross-browser reliability as a first-class constraint
